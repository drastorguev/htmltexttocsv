# htmltexttocsv

## Overview

My thinking is as follows -> every page follows a DOM structure.
This can in theory be represented in a table format.
Hence, I am attempting to write a simple script that would put the text of each div into a CSV table.
MVP: Each new div in a new column!
Goal?: Text from sibling divs should be under the same column?
